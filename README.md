Simulations and analyses for emri

The report that one might be able to measure direct neural activity using MRI produced great excitement.  Our group and many others have been trying to repeat these measurements experimentally, including in human.

As part of that work, we have noted that it is easy to create signals that might be confused with stimulus-driven activity. To help understand the limitations and potential problems with the method, we have created this simulation toolbox.  It simulates a stimulus and then samples the stimulus using the same type of MR sequence that is used in the direct activity measurements.

We refer to these data as eMRI (electrophysiological MRI), which one of us prefers to DIANA (direct analysis of neural activity).
